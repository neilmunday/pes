#	This script is a launch wrapper for PES.
#	Upon exiting, pes.py will write to a file called "commands.sh".
#	Providing this file has been generated and pes.py exited ok,
#	this script will execute the commands in the file.
#	Usually, the commands written to the file will include the launch
#	command for an emulator and calling this script again.
#	By using this process we ensure that the python interpreter is not
#	left running in the background consuming system resources whilst the
#	emulator is running the chosen game.
