# Data

This directory contains data files that are used to populate the PES database.

## Files

* consoles.json -> Console definitions
* mame.json -> Maps short MAME file names to their real names
* pes.db -> The master copy of the PES database - copied to user's home directory if it does not already exist (not stored in git repo)
* retro_games.json -> Cache of game data from RetroAchievements.org (not stored in git repo)

**Note:** `pes.db` and `retro_games.json` are generated by the `bin/create-db` script.
